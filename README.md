# Devlog Entry - [11/13/2024]
## Tools Lead: Jacky and Kenny
# Engine Lead: Ethan and Jasmine
# Design Lead: Ethan
## Tools and Material:
# We will be using Phaser as our game engine because it was the engine that our group was the most familiar with. 
# For programming languages we will be typescript, and JSON will be our primary data language because we've had some exposure to it.
# We will be using Visual Studio Code as our IDE, and common map building tools like Tiled. All of us have visual studio working on our devices already, and we were introduced to Tiled back in CMPM 120.
# For our platform switch we will switch from Typescript to using Javascript.
